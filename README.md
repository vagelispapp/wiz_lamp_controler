# ðŸ’¡ WiZ Lamp Controller (Desktop)

A simple custom desktop GUI to control your **WiZ smart lamps** using their IP addresses â€” built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) and [pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight).

Control multiple lamps from your PC, choose which ones to toggle, adjust brightness, and turn them ON/OFF directly â€” all from a modern, lightweight interface.

## ðŸ–¥ Features

- âœ… Turn individual lamps ON or OFF
- ðŸŽš Adjust brightness with a vertical slider
- ðŸ–± Custom checkboxes to select specific lamps (e.g., Floor Lamp, Desk Lamp)
- ðŸ–¼ Built with a modern Tkinter UI (`customtkinter`)
- ðŸ›  Uses `pywizlight` to talk directly to your WiZ bulbs via local IP
- ðŸ§± Easily portable to `.exe` via `PyInstaller` for Windows users

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install customtkinter pywizlight
```

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Replace the IPs of your lamps in the code:

```python
light_floor = wizlight("192.168.1.X")
light_desk = wizlight("192.168.1.X")
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
python wiz_controler.py
```

3. In the GUI:
   - Select which lamps to control (e.g. Floor, Desk).
   - Adjust the brightness with the slider.
   - Click ON or OFF to apply the command.

4. The window will close automatically and your lamps will respond.

## ðŸ›  Build to EXE (Optional)

You can turn this into a Windows `.exe` using PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed wiz_controler.py
```

The `.exe` will be created inside the `dist/` folder.

You may include a `.spec` file to customize the build if needed.

---


## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Lamp preferences (which ones are selected and brightness) are stored in a `settings` dictionary.
- When the user clicks ON or OFF, the app closes and an `asyncio` function sends the appropriate command using `pywizlight`.
- Supports controlling as many lamps as you want â€” just add their IPs and checkboxes in the code.
